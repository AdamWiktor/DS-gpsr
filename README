Solution by Adam Wiktor

My solution consists of five modules:
1. Gpsr
2. Transmitter
3. MsgQueue
4. Neighbors
5. RadioStart

1. Gpsr module reads recipient and reading every 5 seconds, creates message and
delegates sending it to Transmitter

2. Transmitter broadcasts own location every 10 seconds, receives broadcast and
readings messages from other motes and sends readings' messages to other motes

3. MsgQueue holds a queue of readings' messages to send and keeps track of
retransmissions (and deletes old messages if there were too many of them)

4. Neighbors knows own location and locations of neighbors, and routes messages
according to gpsr protocol

5. RadioStart module was copied from tiny-os example code, but it contains only
one line of actual code (`call RadioControl.start();`), so I hope it is allowed

During development I have found an interesting bug in TOSSIM (I am not sure if
it is a known bug, or maybe it is a feature?). When creating a variable inside
a header file *.h, TOSSIM treats this variable as a global variable for a whole
simulation, which allows unwanted communication between motes.
